This app is in development, thank you for testing it out and providing feedback to me so I can make it as useful and accurate as possible for everyone to use.

You can contact me on GitHub at BETReducation for now.  I'll release more methods as the app progresses and I need less technical feedback. 

Thanks again, your input is truly appreciated.
